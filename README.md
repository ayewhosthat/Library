# Overview
This was a very fun project to undertake; 

### Next Steps
Potential areas for improvement include:
- Handling event listeners for dynamically loaded html elements (see below)
- Making CSS markup more streamlined & more efficient; oftentimes there is repetition and things could be 'grouped' together better, since my focus is making sure one piece works, and then immediately moving on to the next.

### Struggles
The main struggle was getting event listeners attached to the delete buttons on each book's display. Since the books were 
dynamically loaded onto the page via the user filling out the form, the way I attempted to incorporate this behaviour resulted in only the last book being capable of being deleted. Thus, I resorted to an alternative deletion scheme in which the user specified which book they wished to delete inside a modal form.
